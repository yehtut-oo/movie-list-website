# Movie List Web-Application

## Description
The Movie List Application is a web-based platform aimed at movie enthusiasts to browse, search, and save their favorite movies. It utilizes React.js for the front-end development and Express.js for the backend. The application employs CRUD operations to manage movie data stored in a local MySQL database. Key features include the ability to view movie details, add movies to favorites, search for movies, and navigate between pages using React Router. This project serves as a beginner-level exercise in building a full-stack web application using modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
